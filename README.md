# FakeInstaLogin
It is just a simulation app which I made to learn how the protocols work in viewcontroller.
I used UITextfieldDelegate protocol which allows keyboard to be removed away when the return key/other part of screen is pressed.
Also I added function to remove keyboard simply by hitting the loginButton I made.
what you type in textfield(username/password) will be shown labels down below. And insta logo will be changed to login successful logo when you hit loginButton.
